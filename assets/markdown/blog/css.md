 # Sorry to CSS
 ### 8/15/24
 
 I really owe CSS an apology. I’ve only be seriously coding for roughly 2-3 years now, but I definitely feel I have treated css poorly. I’m all about the artsy side of programming that comes along with frontend development. But CSS was only for styling. Colors and fonts, alignment of text, like it was no different than Google Docs or Microsoft Word. But upon taking one of my first HCI classes, I was educated on the true power of CSS: layouts. From grids to flexbox, the world of CSS layouts has opened my eyes. No more jerryrigging page layouts with random padding and margins and struggling to align a div. So many ideas that felt impossible feel more resonable because I know I can make a basic MVP detaling the layout! The HCI class I took is one of so few that have managed to energize me to use what I have learned in my own personal projects. I wish more classes would do the same.
