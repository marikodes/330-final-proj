# JitterDraw

Thanks to the generosity of the donors supporting undergraduate research at Northwestern University, I worked with Dr. Kate Compton over roughly 12 weeks to pursue the generative art research project, Creating a Casual Creator for Anxiety Exploration. The MVP of this idea is [JitterDraw](https://jitterdraw.glitch.me/), a casual creator that allows users to explore what their anxiety looks like visually.
